Need to create - Synthetic Data - Ramesh to tell the system

Now I want to enhance this application with :
1. ability to change transaction category through the natural language interface eg: change Walmart category to food from groceries. The application should make the update for all Walmart transactions
2. Ability to switch to local LLM , make it configurable on the env file
  3. Clean and simple dashboard on the transactions and ability to filter by data range, vendor, category and Month.
  4. Graphical —

Advanced capabilities
1. Ability to track and identify transactions across accounts : example: $1000 transfer from checking account to an investment account, $200 transfer between checking to savings account.  (Potentially fine-tuning)
2. Budget Generation - initial version 
3. Advanced Budget generator based on your spending trends - by category which should editable in simple user interface.
4. warning systems when spending within category gets close to budget limits example: 75%. This should customizable or editable by the user. 


Deployment:
1. Get this deployed on GCP
2. Potential open source model - then we could host it on our account without using a front API call.


User:
1. Get a 360 view of the cash flow
2. Track their spending habits
3. Alerts by vendor if needed
